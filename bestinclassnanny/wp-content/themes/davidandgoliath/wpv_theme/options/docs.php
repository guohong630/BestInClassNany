<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">http://codex.WordPress.org/Installing_WordPress</a></p>
<p>Note: the theme is compatible only with the latest version of WordPress.</p>








<br><br><p><b>Problems Installing? </b></p>
<p>On rare occasions our themes may not be install properly.
If you have any issues with installing the theme, you might want to first check the <a href="http://support.vamtam.com/solution/categories/2296/folders/4759">basic troubleshooting page</a> .
If you need to update a theme to a newer version, check this guide: </p>
<p><a href="http://support.vamtam.com/solution/categories/2296/folders/4678/articles/2752-5-steps-to-update-to-progressio-1-2">How to update the theme? </a></p>




<br><br><br><p><span style="font-size: 24px;">Setting up the Theme</span></p>




<br><br><p>Once you have activated a VamTam theme, you will be directed to the page Quick Import and you will see the theme's menu- VamTam in the Wp main navigation menu on the left. At the top you will see the following warning:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This theme requires the following plugins:</p>
<p><span style="line-height: normal;">WP-PageNavi and Contact Form 7</span></p>
<p>This theme recommends the following plugins:</p>WooCommerce and Woocommerce Menu Cart.
<p>Begin installing plugins | Dismiss this notice </p>




<br><br>




The buttons of the importer will not be active until you install &nbsp;WP-PageNavi and Contact Form 7, so please click on "begin installing plugin". &nbsp;WP Retina, WooCommerce and Woocommerce Menu Cart are optional plugins and there is no need to install them if you do not intend to use them.<p></p>




<br><br><p><b>Quick Import? How does it Help Me?</b></p>




<br><br><p>This is a great feature that helps novice WordPress users and veterans alike. This feature makes the necessary settings/configurations and installs demo content in the WordPress theme: categories, pages, posts and widgets.</p>




<p>Your VamTam theme will look exactly like the one you see on our live preview . It doesn'tmatter if you know WordPress inside out or seen it for the first time, it's always easier to modify posts, categories, pages and widgets that are already there rather then creating them from scratch. Moreover it is easier to understand how your new VamTam theme works.</p>
<p>Our Quick Import is a tremendous feature that will save you a lot of frustration and headache at a press of a button. Try it out. We promise you won’t be disappointed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You can access the feature from your WordPress admin panel:</p>
<p>WP navigation menu =&gt; VamTam =&gt; Quick Import</p>
<p>Please note that the dummy content doesn't come with the original images due to copyright restrictions. You will need to add your images manually.</p>You will notice that widgets, content and Layered Slider demo slides can be imported separately.<p>Click on Save Changes.</p>




<br><br><p><b>Logo</b></p>




<br><br><p>Using a Text Logo</p>




<br><br><ol>
<li>Go to Settings =&gt; General in the WordPress left side navigation menu.</li>
<li>Locate the Site Title item.</li>
<li>Change it to what you like.</li>
<li>Click the "Save Changes" button.</li>
</ol>
<br><br><p>Using an Image as a Logo</p>




<br><br><ol>
<li>Please go to General Settings in the VamTam theme left side navigation menu.</li>
<li>Locate the "Custom Logo Picture" and upload your logo.</li>
<li>Click the "Save Changes" button.</li>
</ol>
<br><br><p><b>Menu</b></p>




<br><br><p>WordPress automatically creates a menu of your pages for you, but the Custom Menu feature gives you complete control of what appears in the menu, where it appears and also the menu title. Many times the page title you want to use will take up big part of the width of your header where the navigation menu appears. Custom menu allows you to shorten or totally change the name that appears in the navigation.</p>




<br><br><p>We use Custom Menus feature in all our themes. If you haven't imported the demo content, you have to create one.</p>

<br><br><br><p><span style="font-size: 24px;">Setting up a slider</span></p>




<br>The theme comes with&nbsp;<b>Layered Slider.</b>&nbsp;<br><p>We always recommend importing the demo content. If you have done so you would have imported the sample sliders that come with the theme and replicate the one on the demo website. You can use these sliders as a starting point for your own website. The "sample sliders" are well designed and complex sliders. If you are not yet familiar with the slider and theme options it is a must to use them.&nbsp;Layered slider is powerful and complex parallax slider. It gives you unlimited opportunities to create slides with many sub layers with different animation.Please note that the Layered Slider is a plugin and have its own option panel found in the main left side navigation menu - Layered Slider WP</p>

<br><br><p>All VamTam themes, comes with extensive documentation and video tutorials that help you install, set up, and edit your theme and you don't even need a lot of WordPress knowledge or programming skills like js, or php. </p>




<br><br><p><b>Contextual
Help Documentation
integrated into WordPress contextual help</b></p>




<span style="">This theme extends WordPress contextual help with many useful
topics. If you get stuck using the
theme, please check this source first. If the topic is not displayed in
contextual help, you may also visit this User
Manual.</span><br><p>To access contextual help simply hoover over the "Help" balloon bellow the titles of each
option .</p>




<br><br><p><b>Support Channels </b></p>
<p>VamTam provides theme related support via our Help Desk, knowledgebase &amp; video tutorials. We may request you to e-mail us your login and ftp details when needed, in which case we will communicate via e-mail to protect your confidential details.</p>




<br><br><p><b>Why not a Support Forum?</b></p>
<p>Simply put, so we can offer you superior support.</p>
<p>A forum works only when you have a large enough active community - thousands of people willing to participate on a daily basis. The smaller the community, the more likely you are to wait for a long time before someone answers your question.</p>




<br><br><p><b>Why not the Themeforest Comment Board?</b></p>
<p>It is not searchable.</p>
<p>The access to the Themeforest account is restricted only to the account holder and the support team cannot get involved.</p>
<p>It is difficult to track the communication.</p>
<p>You can't send sensitive information - ftp/admin credentials.</p>




<br><br><p><b style="">Support Hours</b></p>
<p>Our general support hours are Monday to Friday, 0 - 24h. During this time, we can generally provide feedback on any support queries within 12 - 24 hours, whilst we will also commit to answer any queries during weekends and holidays within 24-36 hours.</p>




<br><br><p><b>Extent of our Support </b></p>
<p>We only cover support for our themes, and cannot give general WordPress support that isn't related to our themes. For general WordPress support you will have to use <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/support">www.WordPress.org/support</a></p>
<p>We understand that there is a fine line between what is considered support &amp; modifications. So whilst we will try to help you with any type of query (support or modification), we cannot provide extensive help in terms of modifications. Technical support will thus take priority over modification support.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<br><p><b>Definition of Modification Support </b></p>
<p>If you are requesting modification help, which only requires us to publish a couple lines of code, we will be glad to assist you. If however your query requires more than that amount of code to be published, we can only provide guidance and you would then need to hire a developer if you don't have the skills to implement it yourself.</p>




<br><br><p><b>Bug Fixing </b></p>
<p>It is our commitment to fix all theme bugs as quickly as possible after they are brought to our attention. During our general support hours, we can fix bugs within 24 - 48 hours.</p>
